My rough plans on DebConf and (part) DebCamp 2018 in Taiwan.

* Debian related packagekit/dep-11/appstream [1][2][3] works
  * More font support on appstream-generator (https://github.com/ximion/appstream-generator)
  * Learn how Debian mirror's DEP-11 data is generated
  * Learn about mesonbuild and D language for appstream code
* I18N works
  * Distribution-wide reasonable defaults
  * IME talk/lightning
* Usual DebConf talks interested
  * policy
  * community and culture
  * salsa.d.o and CI
* More social stuffs
  * Key Signing Party
  * Cheese and Wine party
